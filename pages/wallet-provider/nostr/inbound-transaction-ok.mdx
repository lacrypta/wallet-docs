# Inbound Transaction Ok

This event is used to communicate the successful "minting" of new tokens from the outside world into the Ledger module's attention.

## Event Signature

An _Inbound Transaction Ok_ event has the following form:

```javascript
{
  "id": "{eventId}",
  "pubkey": "{ledgerPubkey}",
  "created_at": timestamp,
  "kind": 1112,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "{minterPubkey}"],
    ["p", "{minterPubkey}"],
    ["e", "{inboundTransactionEventId}"],
    ["t", "inbound-transaction-ok"],
    ...,
  ],
  "content": "{inboundTransactionOkContent}",
  "sig": "{signature}"
}
```

Note:

- the `.pubkey` is the [Ledger module's pubkey](../nostr#federation-public-keys),
- the `.kind` field is `1112` (ie. a regular event),
- both `"p"` tags point to the [URLx module's pubkey](../nostr#federation-public-keys) (ie. the _minter_),
- the `"t"` tag sub-kind is `inbound-transaction-ok`.

The content itself is the JSON serialization of an object of the following form:

```javascript
{
    "tokens": {
        "{tokenName}": tokenAmount,
        ...,
    },
    "memo": "{memoString}"
}
```

An example TypeScript `type` definition for this event's content is:

```typescript
type InboundTransactionOkContent = {
    tokens: Record<string, bigint>,
    memo?: string,
};
```

Not that both of these are equal to those for [Inbound Transaction Start](./inbound-transaction-start) events.

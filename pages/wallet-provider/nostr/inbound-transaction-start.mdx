# Inbound Transaction Start

This event is used to "mint" new tokens from the outside world into the Ledger module's attention.

## Event Signature

An _Inbound Transaction Start_ event has the following form:

```javascript
{
  "id": "{eventId}",
  "pubkey": "{minterPubkey}",
  "created_at": timestamp,
  "kind": 1112,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "{ledgerPubkey}"],
    ["p", "{minterPubkey}"],
    ["t", "inbound-transaction-start"],
    ...,
  ],
  "content": "{transactionContent}",
  "sig": "{signature}"
}
```

Note:

- the `.pubkey` is the [URLx module's pubkey](../nostr#federation-public-keys) (ie. the _minter_),
- the `.kind` field is `1112` (ie. a regular event),
- the first `"p"` tag points to the [Ledger module's pubkey](../nostr#federation-public-keys),
- the second `"p"` tag points to the [URLx module's pubkey](../nostr#federation-public-keys),
- the `"t"` tag sub-kind is `inbound-transaction-start`.

The content itself is the JSON serialization of an object of the following form:

```javascript
{
    "tokens": {
        "{tokenName}": tokenAmount,
        ...,
    },
    "memo": "{memoString}"
}
```

Where the `.memo` entry is optional.
Each `tokenAmount` must be positive, and each `tokenName` must exist in the Ledger module (notice that the `BTC` token **is expressed in milli-satoshis**).

An example TypeScript `type` definition for this event's content is:

```typescript
type InboundTransactionStartContent = {
    tokens: Record<string, bigint>,
    memo?: string,
};
```

# Card Config Change Acknowledgement

This event is used to signal the successful change of an NFC card's configuration for a given client.
It serves as the configuration repository for the client in question, by realizing this via a replaceable event tagged with the client's pubkey.

## Event Signature

A _Card Config Change Acknowledgement_ event has the following form:

```javascript
{
  "id": "{eventId}",
  "pubkey": "{cardPubkey}",
  "created_at": timestamp,
  "kind": 31111,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "{clientPubkey}"],
    ["e", "{acknowledgedEventId}"],
    ["t", "card-config"],
    ["d", "{clientPubkey}:card-config"],
    ...,
  ],
  "content": "{cardConfigContent}",
  "sig": "{signature}"
}
```

Note:

- the `.pubkey` is the [Card module's pubkey](../nostr#federation-public-keys),
- the `.kind` field is `31111` (ie. a parameterized-replaceable event),
- the `"e"` tag points to the [Card Config Change](../card-config-change) event being acknowledged,
- the `"t"` tag sub-kind is `card-config`,
- the `"d"` tag groups all `card-config` events by client pubkey.

The content itself is the [Multi NIP-04](../nostr#multi-nip-04) encryption of the JSON serialization of an object of the following form:

```javascript
{
    "trusted-merchants": [
        { "pubkey": "{merchantPubkey}" },
        ...,
    ],
    "cards": {
        "{cardUuid}": {
            "name": "{cardName}",
            "description": "{cardDescription}",
            "status": "{ENABLED / DISABLED}",
            "limits": [
                {
                    "name": "{limitName}",
                    "description": "{limitDescription}",
                    "token": "{limitToken}",
                    "amount": limitAmount,
                    "delta": limitTimeDelta
                },
                ...,
            ]
        },
    }
}
```

Where the _no_ entry is optional.

An example TypeScript `type` definition for this event's content is:

```typescript
type CardConfigContent = {
    "trusted-merchants": {
        pubkey: string,
    }[],
    cards: {
        [cardUuid: string]: {
            name: string,
            description: string,
            status: "ENABLED" | "DISABLED",
            limits: {
                name: string,
                description: string,
                token: string,
                amount: bigint,
                delta: number,
            },
        },
    },
};
```

# Outbound Transaction Error

This event is used to communicate errors encountered when trying to "burn" existing tokens in the Ledger module.

## Event Signature

An _Outbound Transaction Error_ event has the following form:

```javascript
{
  "id": "{eventId}",
  "pubkey": "{ledgerPubkey}",
  "created_at": timestamp,
  "kind": 1112,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "{minterPubkey}"],
    ["p", "{minterPubkey}"],
    ["e", "{outboundTransactionEventId}"],
    ["t", "outbound-transaction-error"],
    ...,
  ],
  "content": "{outboundTransactionErrorContent}",
  "sig": "{signature}"
}
```

Note:

- the `.pubkey` is the [Ledger module's pubkey](../nostr#federation-public-keys),
- the `.kind` field is `1112` (ie. a regular event),
- both `"p"` tags point to the [URLx module's pubkey](../nostr#federation-public-keys) (ie. the _minter_),
- the `"t"` tag sub-kind is `outbound-transaction-error`.

The content itself is the JSON serialization of an object of the following form:

```javascript
{
    "messages": [
      "{errorMessage}"
    ]
}
```

An example TypeScript `type` definition for this event's content is:

```typescript
type OutboundTransactionErrorContent = {
    messages: [string],
};
```

# Card Config Change

This event is used to change a client's NFC card configuration, including the card's name, description, limits, and trusted merchant list.

## Event Signature

A _Card Config Change_ event has the following form:

```javascript
{
  "id": "{eventId}",
  "pubkey": "{clientPubkey}",
  "created_at": timestamp,
  "kind": 1112,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "{cardPubkey}"],
    ["t", "card-config-change"],
    ...,
  ],
  "content": "{cardConfigChangeContent}",
  "sig": "{signature}"
}
```

Note:

- the `.kind` field is `1112` (ie. a regular event),
- the `"p"` tag points to the [Card module's pubkey](../nostr#federation-public-keys),
- the `"t"` tag sub-kind is `card-config-change`.

The content itself is the [Multi NIP-04](../nostr#multi-nip-04) encryption of the JSON serialization of an object of the following form:

```javascript
{
    "trusted-merchants": [
        { "pubkey": "{merchantPubkey}" },
        ...,
    ],
    "cards": {
        "{cardUuid}": {
            "name": "{cardName}",
            "description": "{cardDescription}",
            "status": "{ENABLED / DISABLED}",
            "limits": [
                {
                    "name": "{limitName}",
                    "description": "{limitDescription}",
                    "token": "{limitToken}",
                    "amount": limitAmount,
                    "delta": limitTimeDelta
                },
                ...,
            ]
        },
    }
}
```

Where the `.trusted-merchants` entry is optional.
The `.cards` entry is _not_ optional, but for any specific value within it the `.name`, `.description`, `.status`, and `.limits` entries are optional.
Finally, within those `.limits` entries that do exist, all their fields are _not_ optional.

An example TypeScript `type` definition for this event's content is:

```typescript
type CardConfigChangeContent = {
    "trusted-merchants"?: {
        pubkey: string,
    }[],
    cards: {
        [cardUuid: string]: {
            name?: string,
            description?: string,
            status?: "ENABLED" | "DISABLED",
            limits?: {
                name: string,
                description: string,
                token: string,
                amount: bigint,
                delta: number,
            },
        },
    },
};
```

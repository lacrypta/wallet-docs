# API Gateway

The API Gateway exposes two endpoints intended to interact with the Local NOSTR Relay.

- **`{base API url}/nostr/dispatch`:** the synchronous NOSTR API endpoint.
- **`{base API url}/nostr/publish`:** the asynchronous NOSTR API endpoint.

## `OPTIONS` Method

Both endpoints accept an `OPTIONS` request method with the following response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
Allow: OPTIONS, POST
{additional headers may be present}
```

## Errors

Upon being requested any method other than `OPTIONS` or `POST`, these endpoints respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
Allow: OPTIONS, POST
{additional headers may be present}
```

Both endpoints expect the body to consist of a NOSTR event JSON, if the content cannot be parsed as a valid JSON object, these endpoints respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
{additional headers may be present}
```

If the request contained an `Accept` header, and said header indicated a media type other than `application/json` or (preferably) `application/nostr+json`, these endpoints respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
{additional headers may be present}

application/json
application/nostr+json
```

If the request's body _can_ be parsed as a JSON object, but this object does not conform to the NOSTR protocol specification, these endpoints respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Content
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
{additional headers may be present}
```

The potential offenses include (but are not limited to):

- missing first-level field: all of the basic NOSTR fields are **REQUIRED** (ie. `.id`, `.pubkey`, `.created_at`, `.kind`, `.tags`, `.content`, and `.sig`),
- malformed field values: malformed `.id`, `.pubkey`, `.created_at`, or `.sig` fields; additionally, malformed `.tags` contents:
  - a single `"k"` tag is required,
  - at least one `"p"` tag is required; additionally, it should not be malformed,
  - at most one `"delegation"` tag is required; additionally:
    - it should not be malformed,
    - it should validate cryptographically, and
    - the conditions query string should match the actual event, and
  - at most one `"alt"` tag is required
- malformed `.content` field

On the other hand, upon successfully parsing and validating the request body, the synchronous NOSTR API endpoint (ie. `{base API url}/nostr/dispatch`) will apply one more validation:

- there should be **EXACTLY ONE** `"p"` tag within the `.tags` field.

If this validation fails, the endpoint rill respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Content
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
{additional headers may be present}
```

Otherwise, the API Gateway will query its internal routing table for the given `"p"` tag value, if no routing information is found, the endpoint responds with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 421 Misdirected Request
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
{additional headers may be present}
```

## Success

Upon successfully parsing and validating the request body, the asynchronous NOSTR API endpoint (ie. `{base API url}/nostr/publish`) will send an `EVENT` message to the Local NOSTR Relay (via WebSockets) with the request body as data and respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
Location: nostr:{nevent}
Content-Length: 0
{additional headers may be present}
```

Where the `nostr:{nevent}` value of the `Location` header conforms to [NIP-21: `nostr:` URI Scheme](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/21.md) pointing to the event id in the request body.

On the other hand, if the additional validation succeeded, and routing information is found for the single `"p"` tag value, the asynchronous NOSTR API endpoint (ie. `{base API url}/nostr/publish`) will forward the request as-is to the corresponding internal module, and respond with **WHATEVER THE MODULE RESPONDED WITH**.

> **NOTE:** In this last case, the API Gateway acts as a _reverse proxy_ for the especific request given.

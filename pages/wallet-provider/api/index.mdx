# API

Although most communication is throught NOSTR, there are some necessary
endpoints.

## lawallet.ar federation endpoint

Our own implementation of lawallet is called lawallet.ar federation, and the api
endpoint is:
```
https://api.lawallet.ar/
```

## Authentication & Authorization

No endpoint uses standard HTTP authentication, but the ones that need
authentication do so by receiving a signed NOSTR event.

## `OPTIONS` Method

All endpoints accept an `OPTIONS` request method with the following response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
Allow: {Allowed methods}
{additional headers may be present}
```

## Errors

Upon being requested any method other than `OPTIONS` or `POST`, these endpoints respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
Allow: OPTIONS, POST
{additional headers may be present}
```

Some Endpoints expect the body to consist of a NOSTR event JSON, if the content cannot be parsed as a valid JSON object, these endpoints respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
{additional headers may be present}
```

If the request's body _can_ be parsed as a JSON object, but this object does not conform to the NOSTR protocol specification, these endpoints respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Content
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
{additional headers may be present}
```

The potential offenses include (but are not limited to):

- missing first-level field: all of the basic NOSTR fields are **REQUIRED** (ie. `.id`, `.pubkey`, `.created_at`, `.kind`, `.tags`, `.content`, and `.sig`),
- malformed field values: malformed `.id`, `.pubkey`, `.created_at`, or `.sig` fields; additionally, malformed `.tags` contents:
  - a single `"k"` tag is required,
  - at least one `"p"` tag is required; additionally, it should not be malformed,
  - at most one `"delegation"` tag is required; additionally:
    - it should not be malformed,
    - it should validate cryptographically, and
    - the conditions query string should match the actual event, and
  - at most one `"alt"` tag is required
- malformed `.content` field

On the other hand, upon successfully parsing and validating the request body, the synchronous NOSTR API endpoint (ie. `{base API url}/nostr/dispatch`) will apply one more validation:

- there should be **EXACTLY ONE** `"p"` tag within the `.tags` field.

If this validation fails, the endpoint rill respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Content
Date: {day name}, {day} {month} {year} {hour}:{minute}:{second} GMT
{additional headers may be present}
```

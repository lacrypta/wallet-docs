## NDK Service

This service module provides functions for managing NDK (Nostr Development Kit) instances.

### Functions:

#### `getReadNDK()`

Returns the NDK instance for fetching events from relays. Creates it if it does not exist.

#### `getWriteNDK()`

Returns the NDK instance for publishing events to the relay. Creates it if it does not exist.

#### `getSignerNDK()`

Returns an NDK instance with a private key signer.

#### `connectToTempRelays(relayUrls: string[], ndk: NDK): NDKRelaySet`

Returns a set of connected relays for publishing. Reuses connections to known relays.

### Usage Example:

```typescript
import { getReadNDK, getWriteNDK, connectToTempRelays } from '@services/ndk';
import NDKRelaySet from '@nostr-dev-kit/ndk';

const readNDK = getReadNDK();
const writeNDK = getWriteNDK();
const relayUrls = ['https://relay1.com', 'https://relay2.com'];

const relaySet = connectToTempRelays(relayUrls, readNDK);

// Use readNDK, writeNDK, and relaySet as needed
```

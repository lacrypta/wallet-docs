# Server Configuration Guide

This guide provides an overview of the server configuration and startup process in the application. It covers key files such as `app.ts` and `index.ts` that play a crucial role in setting up the Express server, connecting to external services, and initializing critical components.

## `app.ts`

`app.ts` serves as the central configuration file for the Express server. It initializes key middleware and sets up security headers, logging, and CORS handling. This file plays a crucial role in defining how the server processes incoming requests and enhances security and development experience through various middleware.

Key Features:
- Initialization of Express application.
- Configuration of logging using Morgan.
- Security enhancements through Helmet middleware.
- JSON body parsing using `express.json()`.
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration.

This file provides a consolidated view of the middleware stack and server setup.

## `index.ts`

`index.ts` acts as the main entry point of the application. It imports and executes the necessary logic to start the server, connect to databases, and set up routes. This file plays a critical role in launching the application and initializing key components.

Key Features:
- Importing and executing server setup logic from `app.ts`.
- Handling environment variable configurations.
- Connecting to databases or external services (e.g., Nostr and Prisma).
- Setting up routes and error handling middleware.
- Starting the Express server to handle incoming requests.

This file provides an overview of the application's startup process and critical dependencies.

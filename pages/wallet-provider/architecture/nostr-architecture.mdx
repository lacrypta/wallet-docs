# Local NOSTR Relay Architecture

The Local NOSTR Relay serves a dual purpose:

1. on the one hand, it makes interacting between cooperating modules extremely simple and uniform,
2. on the other, it allows for all the messages posted therein to be later (or parallelly) published ot external NOSTR relays for auditing.

Internally, the Local NOSTR Relay is implemented thusly:

where:

- **Local NOSTR Relay:** is the local NOSTR relay where NOSTR events are published.
- **Read NOSTR Replica:** these are clusters of NOSTR relays that serve as read-only replicas.
- **C:** the externally-subscribed clients.

Note how this keeps the load on the write-relay relatively low, requiring only as many `REQ` subscriptions as are established by the Internal Modules, and as many replication streams as there are read-only replicas.

The image above shows a simple, single-level replication structure, one could just as easily cascade read-only replicas in a tree structure so as to keep outgoing channels to a minimum in each specific relay; we judge that to only complicate exposition in this case, but large-scale implementations may very well require this.

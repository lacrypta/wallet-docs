# NOSTR Event Anatomy

The expected form of _all_ NOSTR events transferred from, to, and within the wallet provider is as follows (re. [NIP-01: Basic Protocol Flow Description](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md)):

```json showLineNumbers copy /AUTHOR/ /SIGNER/ /TARGET/
{
  "id": "{32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded event ID}",
  "pubkey": "{32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event's SIGNER}",
  "created_at": {UNIX timestamp in seconds},
  "kind": {1112|21111|31111},
  "tags": [
    [
      "k",
      "{event sub-kind}"
    ],
    [
      "p",
      "{32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event's TARGET}"
    ],
    [
      "alt",
      "{human-readable description of the event}"
    ],
    [
      "delegation",
      "{32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event's AUTHOR}",
      "{conditions query string: 'kind={.kind}&created_at>{UNIX timestamp lower limit in seconds}&created_at<{UNIX timestamp upper limit in seconds}'}",
      "{delegation token: 64-byte lowercase hex-encoded Schnorr signature of the SHA256 hash of 'nostr:delegation:{value of the .pubkey field}:{conditions query string}' using the AUTHOR's secret key}"
    ],
    [
      "d",
      "{event sub-kind}:{identifier}"
    ],
    {additional tags may follow}
  ],
  "content": "{stringified JSON content}",
  "sig": "{64-byte lowercase hex-encoded Schnorr signature of the event's .id field using the SIGNER's secret key}"
}
```

The `.created_at` timestamp **MUST** be within 10 seconds of the Local NOSTR Relay's current timestamp (cf. [NIP-22: Event `created_at` Limits](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/22.md)).

The `"k"` tag marks _what_ specific event sub-kind this event refers to.
Note how a single `.kind` is reserved, multiplexing sub-kinds based off of the value of the `"k"` tag.
The actual value of the `"k"` tag need not be an "integer string" and may instead be an arbitrary string (hopefully bearing some mnemonic meaning itself).
This tag is **REQUIRED** and **MUST NOT** be repeated.

At least one `"p"` tag **MUST** be provided, and these tags **SHOULD NOT** be repeated.

The `"alt"` tag is prescribed in accordance to [NIP-31: Dealing with Unknown Event Kinds](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/31.md).
This tag is **OPTIONAL** and **MUST NOT** be repeated.

The `"delegation"` tag follows the guidelines exposed in [NIP-26: Delegated Event Signing](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/26.md).
This tag is **OPTIONAL** and **MUST NOT** be repeated.

The `"d"` tag **MUST ONLY** be present when the event's `.kind` is 31111.
If present, it must consist of the event sub-kind (ie. the value associated to the `"k"` tag), followed by a colon (ie. `:`), followed by whatever the actual identifier is to be (this is so that we can keep using a single kind to refer to _all_ parameterized replaceable events).

The `"d"` and `"delegation"` tags are **mutually exclusive**.
This directly implies that no event with a `.kind` of `31111` may be delegated.

The `.content` field **MUST** be a (properly escaped) stringified JSON object itself.

## Kinds and Sub-Kinds

Notice how we reserve just 3 event kinds for usage:

- `1112`: this is a **regular** event, expected ot be stored by relays.
- `21111`: this is an **ephemeral** event, not expected to be actually stored by relays.
- `31111`: this is a **parameterized replaceable** event, expected to replace any other event with the same kind (ie. `31111`), `.pubkey`, and `"d"` tag value (notice how, because our `"d"` tag values are prescribed to contain the `{event sub-kind}:` prefix, event sub-kinds are also taken into consideration).

## Event's `AUTHOR`, `SIGNER`, and `TARGET`s

A NOSTR event is expected to define three related entities:

- **The event's `SIGNER`:** is the entity actually signing the NOSTR event proper, filling in the `.pubkey` and `.signature` fields.
- **The event's `AUTHOR`:** is the entity _on behalf of whom_ the NOSTR event is being created, found on index `1` of the `"delegation"` tag's content.
  If there's no `"delegation"` tag, then the event's `AUTHOR` is the event's `SIGNER`.
- **The event's `TARGET`s:** are the entities to which the NOSTR event should be routed, these are found on index `1`of each `"p"` tag.

In what follows we'll simply refer to an event's `AUTHOR`, `SIGNER`, and `TARGET`s as defined above, and refrain from referring to specific event fields or tag values or indices.

## Multi-NIP-04

We extend the [NIP-04](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/04.md) specification so as to be able to have multi-recipients.
To that end, the event's `.content` `MUST` be the JSON stringification of the following object:

```javascript
{
  "mac": BASE64_ENCODE(SHA256("{MESSAGE}")),
  "enc": NIP04LIKE_ENCRYPT("{MESSAGE}", "{RANDOM_MESSAGE_KEY}"),
  "key": {
    HEX_ENCODE("{RECEIVER_1_PUBLIC_KEY}"): NIP04_ENCRYPT("{SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY}", "{RECEIVER_1_PUBLIC_KEY}", HEX_ENCODE("{RANDOM_MESSAGE_KEY}")),
    HEX_ENCODE("{RECEIVER_2_PUBLIC_KEY}"): NIP04_ENCRYPT("{SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY}", "{RECEIVER_2_PUBLIC_KEY}", HEX_ENCODE("{RANDOM_MESSAGE_KEY}")),
    ...
    HEX_ENCODE("{RECEIVER_N_PUBLIC_KEY}"): NIP04_ENCRYPT("{SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY}", "{RECEIVER_N_PUBLIC_KEY}", HEX_ENCODE("{RANDOM_MESSAGE_KEY}"))
  },
  "alg": "sha256:nip-04:nip-04"
}
```

Where:

- **`HEX_ENCODE()`:** is a function performing the byte-by-byte hex encoding of its given binary argument
- **`BASE64_ENCODE()`:** is a function performing the base64 encoding of its given binary argument
- **`SHA256()`:** is a function calculating the SHA-256 hash of its given binary argument
- **`NIP04_ENCRYPT()`:** is a function applying the standard NIP-04 encryption
- **`NIP04LIKE_ENCRYPT()`:** is a function generating the same output as NIP04_ENCRYPT, but using the given symmetric key instead of deriving a shared secret from the sender's private key and the recipient's public key

Note that a fixed-length (ie. 16 bytes) random message key is used to encrypt the message itself (`RANDOM_MESSAGE_KEY` in the explanation above), and said key is then itself encrypted under each receiver's public key in turn.
Additionally, the function of the `.mac` field is to ensure that all recipients may check each received the same message.
Finally, the `.alg` field is provided for future extension.

## Federation Public Keys

The `lawallet.ar` federation exposes the following modules and their corresponding public keys:

- Ledger: `bd9b0b60d5cd2a9df282fc504e88334995e6fac8b148fa89e0f8c09e2a570a84`
- URLx: `e17feb5f2cf83546bcf7fd9c8237b05275be958bd521543c2285ffc6c2d654b3`
- Card: `18f6a706091b421bd9db1ec964b4f934007fb6997c60e3c500fdaebe5f9f7b18`

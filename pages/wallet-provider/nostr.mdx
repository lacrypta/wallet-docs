# NOSTR Event Anatomy

The expected form of _all_ NOSTR events transferred from, to, and within the wallet provider is as follows (re. [NIP-01: Basic Protocol Flow Description](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md)):

```json showLineNumbers copy /AUTHOR/ /SIGNER/ /TARGET/
{
  "id": "{32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded event ID}",
  "pubkey": "{32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event's SIGNER}",
  "created_at": {UNIX timestamp in seconds},
  "kind": 11111,
  "tags": [
    [
      "k",
      "{event sub-kind}"
    ],
    [
      "p",
      "{32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event's TARGET}"
    ],
    [
      "alt",
      "{human-readable description of the event}"
    ],
    [
      "delegation",
      "{32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event's AUTHOR}",
      "{conditions query string: 'kind=11111&created_at>{UNIX timestamp lower limit in seconds}&created_at<{UNIX timestamp upper limit in seconds}'}",
      "{delegation token: 64-byte lowercase hex-encoded Schnorr signature of the SHA256 hash of 'nostr:delegation:{value of the .pubkey field}:{conditions query string}' using the AUTHOR's secret key}"
    ],
    {additional tags may follow}
  ],
  "content": "{stringified JSON content}",
  "sig": "{64-byte lowercase hex-encoded Schnorr signature of the event's .id field using the SIGNER's secret key}"
}
```

The `.created_at` timestamp **MUST** be within 10 seconds of the Local NOSTR Relay's current timestamp (cf. [NIP-22: Event `created_at` Limits](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/22.md)).

The `"k"` tag marks _what_ specific event sub-kind this event refers to.
Note how a single `.kind` is reserved, multiplexing sub-kinds based off of the value of the `"k"` tag.
The actual value of the `"k"` tag need not be an "integer string" and may instead be an arbitrary string (hopefully bearing some mnemonic meaning itself).
This tag is **REQUIRED** and **MUST NOT** be repeated.

At least one `"p"` tag **MUST** be provided, and these tags **SHOULD NOT** be repeated.

The `"alt"` tag is prescribed in accordance to [NIP-31: Dealing with Unknown Event Kinds](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/31.md).
This tag is **OPTIONAL** and **MUST NOT** be repeated.

The `"delegation"` tag follows the guidelines exposed in [NIP-26: Delegated Event Signing](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/26.md).
This tag is **OPTIONAL** and **MUST NOT** be repeated.

The `.content` field **MUST** be a (properly escaped) stringified JSON object itself.

## Event's `AUTHOR`, `SIGNER`, and `TARGET`s

A NOSTR event is expected to define three related entities:

- **The event's `SIGNER`:** is the entity actually signing the NOSTR event proper, filling in the `.pubkey` and `.signature` fields.
- **The event's `AUTHOR`:** is the entity _on behalf of whom_ the NOSTR event is being created, found on index `1` of the `"delegation"` tag's content.
  If there's no `"delegation"` tag, then the event's `AUTHOR` is the event's `SIGNER`.
- **The event's `TARGET`s:** are the entities to which the NOSTR event should be routed, these are found on index `1`of each `"p"` tag.

In what follows we'll simply refer to an event's `AUTHOR`, `SIGNER`, and `TARGET`s as defined above, and refrain from referring to specific event fields or tag values or indices.

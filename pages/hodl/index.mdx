# What is HODL.ar (SDK)

HODL.ar is an Community SDK to provide Lightning addresses and NOSTR support for its users.
Its supposed to be easy to deploy on free services such as Vercel or Netlify and assign your own domain.

## Member features

### Nostr handle

Using [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md), your members will have USERNAME@YOUR_DOMAIN as their handle pointing to their Nostr pub key.

### Lightning Address

Using [LUD-16](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/16.md), your members will have _USERNAME@YOUR_DOMAIN_ as their Lightning address pointing to their own wallet.

# La Wallet Documentation

## What is _La Wallet_ ?

An open source crypto wallet that provides ([BoltCard](https://www.boltcard.org)-compatible) [NTAG 424 DNA](https://www.nxp.com/products/rfid-nfc/nfc-hf/ntag-for-tags-and-labels/ntag-424-dna-424-dna-tagtamper-advanced-security-and-privacy-for-trusted-iot-applications:NTAG424DNA) card functionality.
This documentation will be centered around the constituent backend components:

- System Architecture
- Identity Provider
- Wallet Provider
  - Internal Modules

No specific prior knowledge is assumed, but an acquaintance with general software development and analysis practices is assumed.
Furthermore, programming knowledge should suffice to develop all of the La Wallet components from their descriptions herein.

## System Architecture

In a nutshell, the La Wallet System Architecture consists of two main components:

- the Identity Provider
- the Wallet Provider

The Identity provider is presented as a stand-alone component further down.
The Wallet provider is itself a [NOSTR](https://nostr.com)-connected set of inter-cooperating Internal Modules.

Graphically, the System Architecture looks like this:

![System Architecture](assets/system-architecture.png)

The internal components are:

- **API Gateway:** this is the main generic interface with the outside world.
    The API Gateway is in charge of basic authentication, rate limiting, pacing, etc., and it's also the one responsible for routing the given REST request to the module handling it (or to the Local NOSTR Relay, if applicable).
- **Local NOSTR Relay:** this is the backbone of the internal communication framework, **EVERY STATE-CHANGING MESSAGE SHOULD BE RUN THROUGH THE LOCAL NOSTR RELAY**, this is so that messages in the relay may be published to a _public_ relay for auditing.
- **Internal Modules:** these are the interconnected pieces doing the actual work.
    Examples of actual internal modules are: Ledger Module, EVM-Gateway Module, NFC Card Module, etc.

The arrows represent different API accesses to the Wallet Provider System.
These can be categorized thusly:

- **HTTP APIs:** these are accessed via HTTP, and can be further categorized into:
  - **Ad-Hoc APIs:** an HTTP API hosted and routed directly towards an Internal Module, not necessarily REST-full itself; these APIs are provided for in order to allow for pre-existing use-case-specific behavior.
  - **Generic REST APIs:** a REST API aimed at talking to the system as a whole, used mainly for configuration and API management itself.
- **NOSTR APIs:** these are the main backbone of the Wallet Provider proper; they can be divided into "external" or "internal" ones:
  - **External:** these APIs are not _restricted_ to being externally called (ie. they _can_ be used by Internal Modules to communicate with each other), but _are_ exposed to the outside world nonetheless.
      The entities being transferred back and forth in these APIs are NOSTR events proper; sometimes this will be via a NOSTR-specific mechanism, sometimes it will be via HTTP, and this depends on the access pattern expected of it:
    - **Synchronous Write API:** this is REST API implementing a _synchronous_ NOSTR API provided for low-latency scenarios.
        This API will accept a `PUT` method with a NOSTR event as body, and (based off of the first `p` tag) route it to the corresponding Internal Module, waiting for a response, and sending it back to the client.
    - **Asynchronous Write API:** this is a REST API implementing an _asynchronous_ NOSTR API provided for general use.
        This API will accept a `PUT` method with a NOSTR event as body, and publish it to the Local NOSTR Relay, returning a `200` response to the client.
    - **Asynchronous Read API:** this is simply a WebSocket connection to the Local NOSTR Relay, issued one or more `REQ` NOSTR commands.
  - **Internal:** these APIs are realized via the Local NOSTR Relay proper, and consist more of a set of "protocols" than an API like the ones we're used to.
    - **Asynchronous Read/Write API:** a normal `PUB` / `REQ` pair will serve as the "upstream" (ie. `PUB`) and "downstream" (ie. `REQ`) halves of the communication channel.

The API Gateway component itself provides the implementation for:

- **NOSTR Synchronous Write API:** via a `dispatch` endpoint, where a `PUT` method with a NOSTR event as body will be accepted, examined, and (based off of the first `p` tag therein) routed to the corresponding Internal Module, upon receiving a response it is forwarded to the requesting client as-is.
- **NOSTR Asynchronous Write API:** via a `publish` endpoint, where a `PUT` method with a NOSTR event as body will be accepted, examined, and `PUB`'d to the Local NOSTR Relay.

### Local NOSTR Relay Architecture

The Local NOSTR Relay serves a dual purpose:

1. on the one hand, it makes interacting between cooperating modules extremely simple and uniform,
2. on the other, it allows for all the messages posted therein to be later (or parallelly) published ot external NOSTR relays for auditing.

Internally, the Local NOSTR Relay is implemented thusly:

![Local NOSTR Relay Architecture](assets/nostr-architecture.png)

where:

- **Local NOSTR Relay:** is the local NOSTR relay where NOSTR events are published.
- **Read NOSTR Replica:** these are clusters of NOSTR relays that serve as read-only replicas.
- **C:** the externally-subscribed clients.

Note how this keeps the load on the write-relay relatively low, requiring only as many `REQ` subscriptions as are established by the Internal Modules, and as many replication streams as there are read-only replicas.

The image above shows a simple, single-level replication structure, one could just as easily cascade read-only replicas in a tree structure so as to keep outgoing channels to a minimum in each specific relay; we judge that to only complicate exposition in this case, but large-scale implementations may very well require this.

### Internal Module (Generic) Architecture

An Internal Module's generic architecture looks like this:

![Internal Module Architecture](assets/module-architecture.png)

Its constituent parts are:

- **NOSTR _(optional)_ :** the main asynchronous NOSTR interface via which to publish and subscribe to the main NOSTR backbone.
- **Synchronous Nostr _(optional)_ :** a synchronous REST API that accepts a NOSTR event and synchronously acts upon it.
- **Ad-Hoc REST API _(optional)_ :** a set of _ad-hoc_ REST API endpoints to support non-NOSTR-based flows.
- **Internal NOSTR Relay _(optional)_ :** an optional part of the Internal Module's architecture, its purpose is to act as a sort of "local read-only replica", so as to reduce the pressure on the main Local NOSTR Relay whilst at the same time providing all the required `REQ` subscriptions to the module's Business Logic.
- **Resources _(optional)_ :** an Internal Module is free to declare and use as many resources as it sees fit, they're their sole responsibility and the System Architecture at large knows not about them.
- **Business Logic:** the Internal Module's business logic component realizes the module's purpose (it may contain an internal router, expose different sets of ports for different APIs, whatever the Internal Module's writer desires, so long as the API Gateway knows how to interact with it).

**ALL** Internal Modules are required to answer to (at least) one NOSTR Public Key.
Furthermore, the API Gateway needs to know how to route HTTP requests to the appropriate internal module.

In what follows, we'll assume that _all_ Internal Modules implicitly know the public keys every other internal module responds to; furthermore, we'll assume _all_ internal modules implicitly know how to route HTTP requests to the appropriate internal modules.
